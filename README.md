## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Entity Linking

Entity linking is a cute problem in NLP where your are tasked with connecting a mention to an entry in a knowledge base. For example, take the sentence "In order to save Troy, **Paris** had to be sacrificed" -- the mention **Paris** should connect to **Paris (mythological figure)** not the capital of France. 

I tackle this problem by training [bi-encoders](https://github.com/Yokto13/mel) and embedding mentions and entities to the same space.

I also wrote a [datastructure](https://github.com/ufal/linpipe/tree/kbelik) in C++ that uses mmap to store and retrieve structural data from a knowledge base.

[Here](https://github.com/Yokto13/llm-el-reranking) is an experimental repo showing that LLM reranking is harder than it seems.

### Python

[App](https://github.com/Yokto13/Sphinx) that supports learning using active recall questions.

[Small utility](https://github.com/Yokto13/daily-tracker) to track what happend during the day.

### AI

[Here](https://github.com/Yokto13/AI), I gather small AI projects or experiemnts.

### Other

Recently, I've became interested in constrained programming. [Here](https://github.com/Yokto13/picat-learning) are solutions to some practice problems in Picat language.

[Implementation](https://github.com/Yokto13/Strom.jl) of common decision tree algorithms in Julia.
